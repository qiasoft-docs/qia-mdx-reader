# About

This set of documents is written by Johann Huang (aka. "I" in some places of this docset) whose home website is at <https://www.johannhuang.com/>.


## Q&A

Is any of the Qia mdx Reader applications published?

* The application is not yet published
* I may publish it later if ready and necessary (I may never publish it because the creation of this application is my proof of concept of what a good software apllication should and could be; it is more about prototyping and product design and programming design)

Why do I write this set of documents?

* To express my understanding of software product design (including UI and UX)
* To express my understanding of software development, the technology aspect


## Changelog

* 20210529, initialized this documentation website
