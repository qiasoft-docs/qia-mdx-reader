# Electron

Electron plus HTML, CSS and JavaScript without more external libraries are used to open mdx files via double clicking on files, using file dialog to select files and drag'n'drop-ping files.

Worth noticing, I also build my own icon font to make the opened mdx file list list-style-type a little bit more sexy.
