# Technologies

Work in process
{: .label .label-yellow }

Qia mdx Reader has two major versions developed in different technology stacks:

1. Web version: web client developed in JavaScript without external libraries, launcher developed in JavaScript on Electron without external libraries and http and websocket server developed in Python with only one external library `websockets`
2. All in One version: developed in Python with WxPython as GUI library

Having version two does also somehow mean the version one selection of technologies is not any longer prefered, therefore, the nested child pages will only cover technologies used in the new version.
