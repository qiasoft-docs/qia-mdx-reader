# Keyboard Shortcuts

As mentioned in Controls page, keyboard shortcuts can be received by the command line interface control. Besides, keyboard shortcuts can also be received by the content page area to allow easier user interaction with Qia mdx Reader and better user experience.

One secret here is when the command line interface control is empty, it receives keyboard shortcuts as keyboard shortcuts for the application, otherwise, it considers the shortcuts are for the input box supported by the browser in use.

The following table shows the keyboard shortcuts for the application Qia mdx Reader.

| Keyboard Shortcuts | Functionalities | Buttons | Remarks | 
|:---- |:--- |:--- |
| enter | go to current page in timeline records | | = command: @current |
| arrowLeft | go to previous page | ⬅️ | = command: @previous |
| arrowRight | go to next page | ➡️ | = command: @next |
| arrowUp | go to above area of a page | | |
| arrowDown | go to below area of a page | | |
| command + arrowUp | go to the top of a page | | = double click on left magic corner |
| command + arrowDown | go to the bottom of a page | | = double click on right magic corner |
| command + r | play all audio in page | | ~= half of ⏯️ |
